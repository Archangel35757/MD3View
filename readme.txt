This is a slightly modified version of Raven Software's version of Sander Van Rossen and Matthew Baranowski's MD3View.

The unmodified version is available at Sander Van Rossen's blog:

I added some sanity checks to the file loading to get better error messages if it fails 
(a couple of assumptions are made instead of using the specified offsets) and fixed a bug 
with skewing-free glm export (which resulted in tags being slightly offset in (local) X direction) 
as well as adding my name to the credits and appending my initials to the version.
